Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
HTML Structure: Use semantic HTML to structure your video editor interface. Consider elements like <header>, <main>, <footer>, along with <div>s for toolbars, timelines, and the video display area.

CSS Styling: Use CSS for styling your layout, making it responsive and user-friendly. Consider using Flexbox or Grid for layout design. Implement a dark theme similar to professional video editors, focusing on usability in various lighting conditions.

JavaScript Interactions:

File Upload: Implement a file upload feature using JavaScript to allow users to upload video files.
Video Display: Use the <video> tag to display the uploaded video. Implement custom controls for play, pause, rewind, etc.
Editing Tools: Implement tools for trimming, adding text overlays, and transitions between video clips. This could involve manipulating the video timeline and previewing edits in real-time.
Export: Allow users to export their edited video. This will require processing the video with the backend.
Backend (Java with Spring Boot)
Project Setup: Start with Spring Initializr to generate a Spring Boot project with dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA (if you're saving user projects), and any other necessary libraries.

RESTful API Design:

File Upload Endpoint: Create an API endpoint to handle video file uploads. Consider using Spring's MultipartFile for handling uploads.
Editing Operations: Design endpoints for various editing operations (e.g., trim, add text, apply filters). These operations might require additional libraries or tools capable of processing video files.
Export Endpoint: Develop an endpoint to handle the export request, which processes the edited video and makes it available for download.
Video Processing: Integrate a video processing library (e.g., FFmpeg) with your Spring Boot application. Use this library to execute video editing operations requested by the frontend.

Database Integration (Optional): If your application allows users to save projects for later editing, integrate a database using Spring Data JPA. Design your database schema to store user projects, video clips, and edits.

Security: Implement security measures to protect user data and uploaded files. Consider using Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
